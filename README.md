# vibu-coding-challenge

There are two challenges one for [frontend](frontend/) and one for [backend](backend/)

**Note:** This assignment is NOT meant to take a lot of time. Try to not use more than 3 hours! Prefarably just spend 1-2 hours on this assigment. Pick the one you feel most comfortable with.

**If you feel nice** please limit your solution to: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java (spring-boot), C# and for Frontend I'm familiar with Vue and React :smiley:
