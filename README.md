Write a simple API for example it can take a string input on a POST request and "store" this in a DB in memory and then return said string when receiving a GET request.

It could also be a provisioning API, say you send in a POST request to create something with a status: on/off
You can then read the status of this with a GET request.
You can also change the status of this with a PUT request.
